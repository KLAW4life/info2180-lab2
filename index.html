            <h2> Latest LTS version of Ubuntu  </h2>
            <h5> September 25, 2022 by Kerene Wright </h5>

            <p> The latest version of Ubuntu would be the Ubuntu 22.04 LTS "Jammy Jellyfish". In this new version there are some new features that are worth mentioning
                that I think you would like. First thing i noticed is the new customizable options for your pc where you can edit the accents of your desktop. You can also 
                select a light or dark theme version as well. </p>
            <p> Another thing I noticed about this new version is the performance and power improvements of this Linux desktop. This is the most massive upgrade
                for this new version release. Also, GNOME 42 also allows for a new power profile option which allows users to choose between the performance and
                power comsumption from the settings screen. </p>

            <h2>What is Web 3.0? </h2>

            <p>Web 3.0 is a new type of iteration of the www(world wide web) where now, the hosts decentralize apps that are running on blockchain technology. 
                Web 3.0 incorporates concepts such as decentralization, blockchain technologies and token-based economics.</p>
            <p> So what is the whole point of Web3.0? Well......the major talking point about it is that it advocates for user privacy and ownership of 
                data. So now, instead of platforms controlling the data, users can now regain control of your own data, assets and digital identities. It also
                enable users to benefit data privacy.</p>
